# Sprite Assets for Cross-Platform Racer

This directory contains the sprite assets used in the Cross-Platform Racer game. Sprites are 2D images or animations that represent characters, objects, and other visual elements in the game.

## Asset Guidelines

- **Format**: All sprite images should be in PNG format for transparency support.
- **Resolution**: Ensure that sprites are optimized for performance, maintaining a balance between quality and file size.
- **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names for sprite files to easily identify their purpose (e.g., `car_sprite.png`, `track_sprite.png`).

## Usage

Sprites are loaded and managed within the game scenes. Ensure that all sprites are properly referenced in the corresponding scene files to display them correctly during gameplay.
